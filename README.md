A simple CRUD app that utilizes [Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/) as the data store

Here's a list of things I learned while doing this project:
+ `create-react-app` is cool. Don't have to mess with getting webpack or anything like that setup.
    - I did find out the hard way that moving the `index.html` file from outside of the original folder it was in and/or renaming it makes for a bad time. For now, I'm leaving it as `public/public/index.html`, even though it pains me greatly to do so. Also, I don't really want to rename the outer `public` directory, that name makes sense to me (and hopefully others) and I don't know what else to call it.
